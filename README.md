### Hi, there! :wave:
I'm an LLM & CV researcher. Unconventionally, I dropped out of PhD to pursue a research career in the industry. My AI journey began with Andrew Ng's online ML class in 2013.
<!---* :computer: I developed a [continual learning framework for few-shot object detection](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sylph-few-shot-detection).--->
* :computer: I developed [AdalFlow](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow) - The Library to build and auto-optimize Large Language Model Applications.
* :memo: I wrote the open-source book *[Hands-on Algorithmic Problem Solving](https://github.com/liyin2015/Hands-on-Algorithmic-Problem-Solving)*.
